Draw Your Starter
=================

Draw Your Starter is a personal machine learning project, which aims to use a convolutional neural
network to classify user-submitted drawings of starter Pokémon. The project is currently at the
data gathering stage, and so I am collecting Pokémon drawn on an HTML5 canvas webapp. I later plan
to build, train, and serve a Tensorflow model for classifying these drawings, and may write a
tutorial based on this.
